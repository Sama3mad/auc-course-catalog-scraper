Furthermore, variability is an important bottleneck impairing design in scaled technologies.

For the purposes of this class, the term “Nubia” will mean the long stretch of the Nile Valley that extends between the Nile’s First Cataract (located in Southern Egypt just south of the city of Aswan) and its Sixth Cataract (located in the Sudan some distance north of the city of Khartoum). The term “Nubian” will describe the people of this specific area as well as all the distinctive languages and cultures that flourished here from the beginning of recorded history to the early modern period.",

Students will explore the cultural and political agendas of translation through selected theoretical texts. The course will also introduce students to various translation practices (adaptation, e-writing, etc)and will look at a translator’s role in society, and translation as an agent social change. Students will read a selection of texts in literary theory that will inform their practice in translation. Students will situate their own work in translation not only in relation to contemporary cultural forms and practices, but also in relation to the traditions that inform current translating practices. Selected texts and translation exercises will be in English and in Arabic.",

Moreover, students will also discover that Africans have historically resisted violence and oppression just as often as they have promoted it. Students can expect to engage with a variety of interdisciplinary material and will be introduced to different African regions to get a deeper understanding of contexts of violence in Africa’s past and present. By the end of the course students will be able to critically analyze common narratives about “the violent continent” reproduced by mass media.",

What knowledge, skills and dispositions do students need in order to successfully meet the challenges and opportunities that await them as agents of change in an ESD global context? What pedagogies could be utilized to present ESD issues in an interdisciplinary manner bringing together disciplines of science, technology, engineering, arts, humanities, and mathematics? Through exemplars and case studies, participants will be provided with opportunities to critically evaluate ESD policies and practices through an international lens focusing on theories and pedagogical practices. Furthermore, there will be analysis to different curricula design for sustainability components and to the challenges they encounter. This will help focus on how to develop interdisciplinary learning material that is the core essence of ESD and STEAM education and relevant to the community local needs in Egypt.",

It is also a critic skill for the student of pre-modern literature as it is a key source of paratextual information and not only an exercise in positivism. This course applies the idea of taphonomy (the study of fossilization processes) to literary and histological works in Classical Arabic recorded in the tadwin period. Rather than seek to legitimize or delegitimize a given text based on its historical authenticity or provenance, this course demonstrates how to integrate the dimensions of a text’s transmission and its context into the study of literary material. Students will be introduced to the university’s manuscript holdings and will each present an unedited literary text of their choosing to the class. Students will edit a portion of these MSS and analyze these texts in their final paper.",

To the uninitiated, classical Arabic poetry can seem recondite, vague, or inconsequential and accordingly some students of pre-modern Arabo-Islamic history often prefer to bypass the poetic material they encounter in their research. By doing so, however, researchers risk ignoring a valuable source of historical information, especially regarding the affective dimensions of cultural, social, and political history. This course will train students to read classical Arabic poetry, to decipher its occasionally difficult syntax and figurative codes, and to relate poems to the contexts in which they appear. We will pay special attention to how poetry is deployed in historiographical works  and how it relates to the context in which it is presented. The course will cover subjects that should be of interest to historians:politics, war, death, memory, elites and non-elites, gender and sexuality, and modernity.",

Under “New Regionalism”, regionalist schemes cover issues of economic, social, cultural and, in some cases, security nature. As they display great diversity, the course will review the different expressions contemporary regionalism has taken up, which reflect diverse conditions, values and ideological approaches. The review will be carried out against the background of the global system since it is considered that regionalism is a response to globalization and a reaction to the diverse aspects of global processes. The course is also about regional integration, which indicates processes in given regions extending from close intergovernmental cooperation between “sovereign” states to integration as such, involving the creation of new organizational or supranational entity. After a conceptual introduction, regionalism in Europe, the Arab Middle East and Africa, as well as in Latin America and Asia will be examined.",

Moreover, it promotes students’ critical thinking and problem-solving skills. It also increases students’ leadership and communication skills such as interpersonal (conversing with community groups), interpretive (reading research), and presentation skills (presenting research done). The course requires students to come up with out of the box practical solutions to the problems of real cases from the Employee Emergency Relief fund and community service clubs on campus. Students are asked to submit reflection papers, give several presentations, in addition to a final project. To this end, students will be introduced to the linguistic tools necessary to express their ideas in written and spoken Arabic. Authentic materials which enhance students’ different Arabic language skills will be introduced in class and in the form of assignments. Moreover, authentic reading and listening materials on community engagement, NGOs, philanthropists, fundraising, and marketing through social media will be provided. This course will be offered to Arabic native speakers in Fall and Spring semesters.",

This course explores how structures of domination - capitalism, white supremacy, and patriarchy - have been historically codependent through systems of law and governance. It also explores how feminist movements have critically navigated around and against these structures of domination through law, and other means. Gender justice has been at the core of international human rights law and practice in the Global South. This course makes explicit broader theoretical questions about the relationship between law and patriarchy through classic texts on feminism, transfeminism, queer theory, critical race feminism, and masculinity studies, among other approaches. It engages with various themes that initially developed from outside of the academy, such as intersectionality, and capitalism’s reliance on unpaid housework, cohering feminist movements as spaces of knowledge-production, and for the articulation of feminist methodology. The course therefore focuses on how feminist methodology can reveal the distributional effects of legal outcomes, break gender binaries, and complicate North-South dichotomies.",

Its roots can be traced to anthropology, philosophy and sociology and its use as a method of inquiry goes back to the early decades of the twentieth century. Qualitative approaches are becoming part of alternative forms of research in medicine as practitioners look at the complex health issues that are often confronted. Qualitative research tends to seek answers to problems about which little is known and its aim is to elicit explanations from the “patient’s point of view”; thus seeking the meaning or the experience of the individual. In other words, qualitative methods enable researchers to access areas of inquiry not typically amenable to quantitative research. In contrast, the use of “objective” measures based on diagnostic criteria, whether physiologically or laboratory-based often rely on numbers, but cannot be completely removed from qualitative aspects of a diagnosis. The aim of this course is to introduce some of the qualitative and quantitative research methods currently used in health care research and to explore how they can be appropriately and fruitfully employed.",

        "description": "Diseases have meanings and those meanings translate into the way in which sufferers and society perceive and engage with their disease. Discourse on disease is often most charged when the disease in question threatens to cross borders, socioeconomic, national, or otherwise and, in these instances, the media is often complicit with “othering” the disease in a way that may have very real, material consequences. Examples from recent media coverage that have “otherized” the etiology of diseases, whether the disease covered is SARS as an Asian disease, the swine flu as a Mexican disease, Tuberculosis as an immigrant disease, or HIV/AIDs as a Haitian disease. In addition, effective therapy and support is often hampered by how social perception stigmatizes diseases such as mental illness, autism, Down syndrome and the like. This is no less so in the case of the sufferer’s self-image: when a woman undergoes a radical mastectomy, or when one is the victim of a disfiguring accident. The outcome, in terms of disease management and resources, is further influenced by the media’s shaping of society’s perception of the “disease of the day” through language. Through a look at several case studies and current literature, this course will focus on the ways in which disease takes on meaning and, in many cases, emerges as a signifier for something altogether different.",

In an interdependent environment, questions of water and air quality have political and social ramifications, with human health being the victim. The efforts to increase agricultural yields through pesticide and synthetic fertilizer use and chronic illness are no longer issues confined to a village or a limited region. The race for prosperity through industrial development and adoption of the superficial trappings of prosperity are not without their medical consequences.

For Nanotherapeutics, many biologically active compounds that have the desired activity in vitro never make it to the clinic because of poor solubility, malabsorption, instability, short half-life, poor safety profiles, and/or sub-optimal efficacy profiles. By encapsulating or binding such compounds with nanostructures, the fate of the compound in the body is determined by the characteristics of the nanostructure. By carefully designing and engineering the nanostructure properties we can improve target accumulation while avoiding toxicity-sensitive tissues. For some biological drugs, like non-coding RNAs, combination with a nanostructure appears even a requirement to cross the many barriers on its way to site of action. For these strategies, nanomedicine is an integral part of drug development in the treatment and early detection of various disorders. For Nano diagnostics, the small volume and extremely high surface area of nanoparticles offers attractive properties for binding specific diagnostic probes that provide functional information. For thoronstics, where diagnostics and therapeutics are combined, nanotechnology is an attractive proposition.

        "description": "This course lays down the foundation in basic genetic concepts with the objective of understanding the hereditability and/or molecular basis of disease. Recent evidence and diagnostic procedures suggest that genetic diseases make up a large proportion of the total disease burden in both pediatric and adult populations. Today′s health care practitioner and biomedical scientist must understand the science of medical genetics and the consequences of altered genomics and proteomics. Advances in the development of new and more accurate methods of diagnosing hereditary disease have led to a greater “genetic awareness” and recognition that genetics plays a role in all areas of medicine. Using a wide spectrum of examples, it will illustrate the impact of mutations as found in thalassemias, sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, familial Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Huntington’s Disease as causes of disease. It will also discuss genetics as a predisposing factor, such as in the case of birth defects, breast cancer, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s Diseases, alcoholism and some autoimmune disorders. Environmentally-induced mutagenesis and carcinogenesis and the role of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes will be a particular focus of the second half of the course.",

Systems biology integrates genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic technologies to construct models of complex biological systems and diseases. Together, these technologies allow us to interrogate and refine our knowledge of cellular processes. This course will use a systems biological perspective to detail the most recent findings that link the environmental to human neurological disease. The course will include an assessment of systems-based tools to evaluate environmental health risks, an overview of molecular pathways that are essential for cellular survival after exposure to environmental stressors, recent findings on gene-environment interactions influencing environmental agent-induced diseases, with a nervous system focus, and the development of computational methods to predict susceptibility to these environmental etiological factors. Environmental stressors relevant to human health and disease, high-throughput technologies, and biological pathways associated with compromised function are integrated with earlier coursework on molecular and cellular biology, toxicology, pathology, and computational biology.",

It addresses two central questions that top managers ought to answer: 1) What (international) businesses shall we get into and/or out of? And 2) How to compete? Considering both the firm’s unique characteristics and the structure of the markets where it competes. Through readings, case studies, a business strategy simulation, and interactive lectures, students are exposed to the latest techniques and methodologies for crafting corporate, business, and functional strategies meant to improve firms’ local and international competitiveness. Students will also be introduced to the relevant analytical techniques for diagnosing the competitive position of a business, and assessing alternative strategic directions in a global context. This course discusses topics related to global strategic management. Most students who join this program would have already taken an undergraduate strategy course. Accordingly, this course would not be discussing main stream strategy topics but rather topics related to global challenges in a dynamic global environment with special emphasis on the role played by technology and innovation in transforming the way global business is being conducted and strategies being formulated.",

Could a sufficiently complicated artificial neural network or robot be a conscious agent, in the fullest possible sense? Questions such as these clearly straddle a boundary between conceptual analysis and empirical science. Therefore, philosophy of mind is an interdisciplinary subject, which draws on cutting-edge research from a diverse range of fields, including psychology, neuroscience, cognitive science, and computer science",

Beyond the deep-dive in the selected topics, this course also aims to review and expand the students’ horizons in how the literature reviews can be different depending on the type of article. We will explore, by example, how methodologies are formulated, data is collected, analyzed, and presented, how insights are gleaned and discussed, and how research agendas are developed and staged. Finally, the students will be drilled to formulate an idea for a research paper based on the topic studied.",

The contemporary philosophical discourse on media and the manner in which our use of them constitutes historical formations of subjectivity, sociality and culture at large presents itself in a variety of methodological guises (media-historical, neomarxist, phenomenological, post-structuralist, semiotic, system-theoretical) which can all contribute to our reflection on and critique of the cultural and developmental pathways media-technologies encode and disclose.",

        "credits": "3",
        "description": "Creating a successful sculpture requires an imaginative and innovative concept as well as a sound design that utilize the potential and avoid the limitations of the materials and the processes used in making it. This course discusses the global aspects of sculpture and the close interrelationship between the social and political constraints on the sculptors in creating their artwork. Topics explored will include issues of interpretation and audience interaction, the social responsibility of the artist especially in creating public art to heighten social and political awareness and sensitivity to certain issues and to start discussions relating to them. The characteristics of the wide range of materials and processes of sculpture will also be compared and contrasted in order to help the students appreciate their esthetic qualities and understand their potential in creating works of art. An important part of the course is a hands-on component, where students, individually and collaboratively, create works of sculpture.",

Hands-on implementation of computational tools is exercised during lab sessions by means of parametric modelling and digital fabrication software. Students work back and forth between physical material experimentation and digital translation of parameters, rules, constraints and relationships to develop their solutions in applied design projects. In the process, students learn how to automatically extract data from parametric models for multiple purposes, including but not limited to digital fabrication, environmental analysis, and documentation and detailing.",

Countries of origin are mainly concerned with releasing pressures over their labor markets, the protection of migrants, their welfare, maximizing the contributions of migrants to development through financial remittances and their productive use, effective return migration policies, migration statistics, and international cooperation. The course will examine how a selected number of countries of origin and destination formulated and implemented policies in the respective areas of concern to the two sets of countries.",

It is also about learning how to understand and how to be understood. It teaches students to listen to what others say, interpret what others have written, and take responsibility for one’s own words. This is accomplished through reading texts of great intellectual distinction, patiently practising the art of interpretation without easy answers, and carrying out a sustained effort to write thoughtfully.

        "credits": "3",
        "description": "Although the emphasis on the importance of a systematic philosophical reflection of language is a characteristic feature of its development in the 20th century which, thus, has been described as taking a ‘linguistic turn’, the philosophical interest in language is, nonetheless, almost coeval with the ancient origins of the discipline. As a result of this perennial interest, philosophers have studied various dimensions of language and the ways in which it is constitutive of the way we conceive of ourselves, relate to the world, establish and preserve political communities and partake in a shared historical world of meanings and linguistic practices. This course, consequently, aims at a both historically and systematically informed exploration of these dimensions of language in its philosophical reflection.",

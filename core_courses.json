It is also about learning how to understand and how to be understood. It teaches students to listen to what others say, interpret what others have written, and take responsibility for one’s own words. This is accomplished through reading texts of great intellectual distinction, patiently practising the art of interpretation without easy answers, and carrying out a sustained effort to write thoughtfully.

Students look at the social and personal uses of writing, consider what writing makes possible, and the ways we take it for granted in daily life. By exploring different forms of writing, students experiment with writing, and research the different methods adopted by scientists and authors from different cultures, to gain new perspectives. By looking at the relationship between thought and language, the course surveys the ways written expression has been used as a tool for reconstructing perception, memory, and self in society. It also employs writing to explore and analyze complex issues in today’s rapidly-changing world.",

Topics explored will include issues of interpretation and audience interaction, the social responsibility of the artist especially in creating public art to heighten social and political awareness and sensitivity to certain issues and to start discussions relating to them. The characteristics of the wide range of materials and processes of sculpture will also be compared and contrasted in order to help the students appreciate their esthetic qualities and understand their potential in creating works of art. An important part of the course is a hands-on component, where students, individually and collaboratively, create works of sculpture.",
